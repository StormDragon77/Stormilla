Describe the bug in a clear and concise way and add screenshots or videos as they help show the problem clearly. Please make sure your issue is not caused by another pack before reporting.

Java only: Make sure you are running the pack on the intended game version for it, older versions are not supported. State whether you are in vanilla, have OptiFine or have Fabric/Quilt mods and if so then list what mods you are using. The only mods I am currently supporting are client side mods that are resource pack enhancers. Mainly OptiFine and alternative mods that have OptiFine features implemented in the OF format.
