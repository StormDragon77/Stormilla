You can suggest or report a bug by opening a new issue in Issues

Stormilla only supports the latest release of Minecraft. The only mod Stormilla currently supports is the latest release of OptiFine.

If you need to contact Storm to ask about the pack or if you want to use assets, you can do so through Discord: StormDragon77#0675, PMC: StormDragon77 or Twitter: @StormDragn77. You should get a reply within a day.

# Leaving an Issue:

- If an issue is marked as added or fixed but is not in the latest release, it will be in the next one.

BUGS:

    Missed Textures and Inconsistencies, Texturing and Modeling Errors, Unnecessary Files within Pack, Typos in Description and Outdated Preview Images on PMC

- Specify what platform you are on (Java or bedrock)

    - Any version of Stormilla that is not the latest is not supported. Check if your issue persists in the latest release.
    - Old versions of Minecraft and Optifine are not supported so check if the bug is present in the latest release.

    - Lighting on tripwire sting on hook model (Mojang bug), end crystal skins for end and nether not rendering (Optifine bug)
------------------------------
SUGGESTIONS:
- Your suggestion will be marked invalid/declined if it strays too far from vanilla, is not an inconsistency or is impossible to add.
- Here's my design principles for this pack to show everything I plan on adding to this:
	- Fix Inconsistencies, fix every texture and model bug a resource pack can fix
	- Art Style Consistency, Minecraft's current default pack isn't entirely consistent. Some models and textures look old whether they be over-detailed, under-detailed, have a messy color palette or are just a different art style. Some of these are on purpose such as diamond ore and the creeper due to their iconic look but I will still be updating those too anyway.
	- Pixel Consistency, most of the game is already pixel consistent. There are just a few textures that have a different resolution compared to a block. If the pixels are not the same size as the ones on a dirt block then it will be fixed if possible.
	- Less Uniformity, any texture that is simply a recolor of an existing texture will be made more unique like the ore changes in 1.17
	- Palette Consistency, Textures of the same material will have the same or a similar color palette (with possibly some exceptions such as iron block and anvil).
	- Unflatten Textures, Some textures look too flat in shading and that will get fixed.
	- Parity, Bedrock and java will be as similar as a resource pack allows.
	- Realism, Some things will be more realistic but of course keeping the vanilla style.
	- Item Model Consistency, some are 2D and some 3D. I am making non-full blocks, except stairs and slabs, 2D
	- Vanilla Building Blocks, I may make tweaks to them but I will not be drastically changing them. I don't want your builds to look too different with this pack on.
- Please don't request adding other people's assets. Most of the time the answer is no, I like making the assets myself. You can however request an idea from another pack that you like and I might do my own spin on it.
- If you are looking to contribute something, I am not looking for contributors currently but if you want you can still send something you made my way. Remember: there's no guarentee that it will get added and if it does you will of course be properly credited.
- Suggestions that are not possible to add as far as I know: 

     - Changing sounds of certain blocks, changing models of armor, fishing bobber, shield
- Suggestions that too drastically change building blocks will not be added (or could potentially be added via addon pack) I don't want this pack to drastically change the look of builds so your builds won't look weird for people who don't have this pack on.
